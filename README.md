# Security+ (SY0-701) Notes 
_by jpototo_

This is my personal study repository for **CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701)**.

I'm currently self-learning cybersecurity from scratch while preparing to transition into the field â€” with **no solid IT/security background before starting**. I really struggled with the exam structure and content at first, but with the right resources and a method that fits your pace, itâ€™s absolutely doable.

## Beginner-Friendly Study Tips

Started from scratch and not sure how to begin? Me too.

Hereâ€™s what I would do if I could start over:

- Study in **short sessions** (30â€“45 mins), with a total daily limit of ~3 hours max
- Use **GPT or chat tools** to explain anything you donâ€™t understand â€” "Explain like Iâ€™m 10 y/o."
- For tough concepts, rewrite the meaning in **your own words**
- Donâ€™t just re-read theory â€” look up **how the terms are tested** in real exam-style questions
- Accept that you wonâ€™t retain everything in 1â€“2 passes â€” **repetition is key**
- Many people use Professor Messer or Dionâ€™s materials. Personally, Messer helped with ~50â€“60% of my understanding, but I still had to **research a lot outside** of it

Hereâ€™s the combo that worked best for me ðŸ‘‡
